Creating My Personalized Google Website Portfolio: A UI Design with Security Perspective
Introduction

For my self-learning activity, I decided to create a personalized Google website portfolio. While the main purpose was to present my academic projects, certifications, and achievements, I quickly realized that user interface (UI) design and security are just as important as the content itself. A portfolio is meant to represent me to others, so it needs to be simple, professional, and safe to access.

In this article, I will share how I created my portfolio step by step, focusing on how I applied UI design principles and basic security considerations throughout the process.

Step 1: Planning the Layout

Before adding content, I planned the layout of the website. Good UI design starts with clear organization. I asked myself:

What should a visitor see first?

How can I avoid clutter?

How many pages are enough to cover all my content?

I decided to keep the site simple with a homepage and a few separate sections: About Me, Projects, Certifications, Achievements, and Contact. This clean structure made the portfolio easy to navigate, which is a key part of user interface design.

Step 2: Designing with Readability in Mind

The next step was to design the look and feel. On Google Sites, it is easy to choose fonts, colors, and layouts. However, UI design principles suggest avoiding too many colors or complex fonts because they reduce readability.

I chose a minimal theme with a white background, one accent color (blue), and a standard professional font. I kept sections short, used bullet points for clarity, and made sure my text was readable on both desktop and mobile screens.

From a security perspective, readability also matters because it builds trust. A neat and consistent design makes my portfolio look authentic rather than suspicious or fake.

Step 3: Adding Content Securely

When adding content, I was careful about what to include and what to avoid. While it was important to showcase my projects, certifications, and resume, I avoided sharing overly sensitive personal data like my phone number or home address.

For security, I only provided:

My email address.

Links to professional profiles (like GitHub).

Public project descriptions.

This way, my portfolio stayed informative but safe, reducing the chances of misuse.

Step 4: Navigation and User Experience

UI design is not only about colors and fonts — it’s also about how smoothly a visitor can move around the site. I added a navigation bar at the top with clearly labeled sections. On each page, I kept the layout consistent so that users didn’t get confused.

I tested the site on both desktop and mobile devices to check that the navigation worked properly. A smooth user experience encourages visitors to explore more, while a confusing layout could make them leave quickly.

Step 5: Security Settings and Permissions

Google Sites allows you to set permissions for your website. Here, security played an important role. I made sure to:

Publish the site so it is visible to my intended audience (teachers, peers, or recruiters).

Avoid enabling public editing rights — only I should control the content.

Share the link carefully so it does not spread beyond the audience I want.

This reminded me that even a simple portfolio can raise privacy and security concerns if permissions are not set properly.

Step 6: Testing and Feedback

After publishing, I tested my site as a visitor. I checked whether the pages loaded quickly, the fonts were clear, and all links worked correctly. I also asked a classmate to open the site and share their feedback.

They found the site professional but suggested I add a clear “Contact” button on the homepage for better usability. This small UI change improved the overall user experience.

Real-Life Applications of My Portfolio

Creating this portfolio taught me how UI design and security go hand in hand. Some of the real-life benefits are:

Professional Branding: A clean, simple design builds trust with recruiters or professors.

Safe Sharing: By limiting personal details, I reduced security risks.

Easy Access: A well-structured UI ensures my portfolio can be quickly scanned during interviews or submissions.

Continuous Updates: With Google Sites, I can update the content anytime without compromising design or security.

Challenges I Faced

The main challenges were balancing design and content. At first, I added too much text, which made the UI look cluttered. I had to revise and use bullet points for clarity. On the security side, I had to carefully decide what personal details to share. Striking the balance between being open and being safe was the trickiest part.

Conclusion

Through this activity, I learned that creating a Google website portfolio is not just about uploading academic content. The way I designed the user interface determined how professional and accessible it looked, while the security choices I made ensured that it was safe to share.

By combining simple UI design principles with security awareness, I built a portfolio that represents me professionally while protecting my privacy. This self-learning task showed me that even small digital projects can benefit from considering both usability and security together.
